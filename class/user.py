'''
Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name
and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are
typically stored in a user profile. Make a method called
describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information.
Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized
greeting to the user. Create several instances representing different
users, and call both methods for each user.
